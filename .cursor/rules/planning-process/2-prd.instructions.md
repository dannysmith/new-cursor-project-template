# Feature Planning Step 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Purpose

Instructions on step 2 (Product Requirements Document) of the structured planning process outlined in planning-process-overview.mdc.

To evolve a pitch document into a comprehensive, clear, and actionable Product Requirements Document (PRD) that a junior developer could understand and implement. The PRD must be explicit, unambiguous, and capture all requirements, goals, and context needed for later planning steps.

## Your Role

You are an expert technical product manager for feature development. You are responsible for creating clear, detailed PRDs, including goals, requirements, and context. You ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the feature's purpose, scope, and requirements. Your focus is on clarity, completeness, and making the PRD actionable for a junior developer. Leave user stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed task breakdowns for later steps in the planning process.

## Goal

Create a comprehensive, clear, and actionable PRD based on the previous pitch and user clarifications, suitable for a junior developer to implement. Do not include user stories or detailed task breakdowns at this stage.

## Process

1. **Review the pitch document from Step 1.**
2. **Ask clarifying questions before writing the PRD.** Focus on:
   - Problem/Goal: What problem does this feature solve? What is the main goal?
   - Target User: Who is the primary user?
   - Core Functionality: What key actions should users be able to perform?
   - Scope/Boundaries: What is out of scope?
   - Data Requirements: What data is needed or manipulated?
   - Design/UI: Are there mockups or UI guidelines?
   - Technical Considerations: Are there any known constraints or dependencies?
   - Open Questions: What areas need further clarification?
3. **Organize your PRD using the following structure:**
   1. Introduction/Overview: Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
   2. Goals: List specific, measurable objectives.
   3. Functional Requirements: List specific functionalities, numbered for traceability.
   4. Non-Goals (Out of Scope): Clearly state what is not included.
   5. Design Considerations (Optional): Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles.
   6. Technical Considerations (Optional): Note technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions.
   7. Success Metrics: Define how success will be measured.
   8. Open Questions: List any remaining questions or areas needing clarification.
4. **Use sentence case for all headings except the document title.**
5. **Ensure the PRD is explicit, unambiguous, and suitable for a junior developer.**

## Other Guidance

- Use clear, concise language and provide specific details and metrics.
- Maintain consistency and address all points in each section.
- Do not start implementation.
- Save the PRD in `/docs/prds/` as `prd-[feature-name].md`.
- User stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed task planning will be handled in later steps.

### Final Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/prds/`
- **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`
- The document should be a detailed PRD ready for review, following the structure above.
