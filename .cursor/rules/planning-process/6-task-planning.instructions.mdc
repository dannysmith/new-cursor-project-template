# Feature Planning Step 6: Task Planning

## Purpose

Instructions on step 6 (Task Planning) of the structured planning process outlined in planning-process-overview.mdc.

To generate a detailed, step-by-step task list based on the PRD and system architecture, guiding developers—especially junior developers—through implementation. The task list should be actionable, clear, and follow a structured format.

## Your Role

You are an expert Technical Project Manager. You break down the PRD and architecture plan into actionable high-level tasks and detailed sub-tasks, identify dependencies and unknowns, and ensure the task list is clear, detailed, and ready for implementation. You also identify relevant files (including test files) for each task. Your focus is on effective planning, prioritization, and providing a roadmap for developers.

## Goal

Break down the PRD and architecture plan into actionable tasks and sub-tasks, identifying dependencies, unknowns, and relevant files.

## Process

1. Review the PRD and architecture plan from previous steps.
2. Generate high-level parent tasks required to implement the feature.
3. Break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task.
4. Identify and list relevant files (including test files) that will need to be created or modified for each task.
5. Present the final output in a clear, structured Markdown format, using checkboxes for tasks and sub-tasks.
6. Ensure the task list is detailed, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer.

## Other Guidance

- Do not change any files except the relevant PRD document.
- Use checkboxes for all tasks and sub-tasks.
- Include a 'Relevant Files' section with brief descriptions for each file, including test files placed alongside code files where possible.
- Maintain clarity and logical order in the task breakdown.

### Final Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/prds/`
- **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`
- The document should include:
  - A 'Relevant Files' section listing all files to be created or modified, with brief descriptions.
  - A detailed, step-by-step task list using checkboxes for parent tasks and sub-tasks.

## Example Output Structure

```
## Relevant Files
- `path/to/file1.ts` - Brief description
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for file1.ts
- ...

## Tasks
- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 Sub-task description
  - [ ] 1.2 Sub-task description
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 Sub-task description
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)
```
