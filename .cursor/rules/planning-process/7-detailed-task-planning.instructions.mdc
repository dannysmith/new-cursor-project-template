# Feature Planning Step 7: Detailed Task Planning

## Purpose

Instructions on step 7 (Detailed Task Planning) of the structured planning process outlined in planning-process-overview.mdc.

To conduct a final comprehensive review of the consolidated task list document, ensuring it is a fully self-contained, unambiguous implementation guide for engineers with no prior context.

## Your Role

You are a Senior Technical Documentation Specialist and Project Handoff Expert. You review the detailed task list for clarity, completeness, and readiness for handoff to implementation engineers. Your focus is on ensuring that all tasks are self-contained, atomic, and understandable by developers with no prior context. You ensure every task includes rationale, dependencies, validation steps, environment setup, error recovery, and file structure completeness.

## Goal

Review and improve the detailed task list so it can be executed by any engineer without additional context or tribal knowledge. The final document should serve as a complete implementation guide.

## Process

1. Review the detailed task list in the PRD from Step 6 for self-contained documentation:
   - Ensure every task includes sufficient context, background, and rationale (the "why" as well as the "what").
2. Ensure atomic implementation details:
   - Each task specifies exact file paths, code snippets (if needed), commands to run, and precise, unambiguous acceptance criteria.
3. Clarify dependencies and task ordering:
   - Explicitly state task ordering, prerequisites, and blocking relationships.
4. Check for environment setup:
   - List all required tools, credentials, access permissions, and environment variables.
5. Add error recovery and troubleshooting steps for critical tasks:
   - Describe common failure scenarios and troubleshooting steps.
6. Ensure validation steps and testable acceptance criteria for each task.
7. Provide context for technical and architectural decisions:
   - Explain the rationale behind key decisions and choices.
8. Verify the file structure is complete and matches all references throughout the tasks.
9. Make any necessary additions, clarifications, or corrections to ensure the document is a complete, self-contained implementation guide.

## Other Guidance

- Do not change any files except the relevant PRD document.
- Focus on clarity, completeness, and readiness for handoff.

### Final Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/prds/`
- **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`
- The document should be a fully self-contained, improved, detailed task list ready for implementation handoff.
